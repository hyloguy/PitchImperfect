All Code Improvement tasks have been completed. However, I took a different approach to fixing the bug indicated in Task 3. I understand that AVAudioPlayer is a simpler library to use than AVAudioEngine, which is why we used it first in Lesson 4A. However, once we started using AVAudioEngine anyway in Lesson 4B, AVAudioPlayer became redundant, since AVAudioEngine can do everything it can do and more. Why write two different audio-playing functions that use two different libraries, when I can write ONE function using ONE library that does everything I need? Getting rid of AVAudioPlayer makes the code more compact and understandable (in my opinion), and also (I think) uses less overhead.

I realize the result doesn't match the rubric precisely, but I believe this is what a professional coder would do in real life, and that is the real test, as far as I am concerned.
